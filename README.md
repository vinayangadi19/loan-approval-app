\## 📄 Resume / Interview Summary



> \*\*Loan Approval Prediction System\*\*  

> Developed a machine learning web application using Streamlit and scikit-learn to predict loan eligibility based on user inputs like income, credit history, dependents, and employment status. Achieved 76% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier on a real-world Kaggle dataset. Cleaned and preprocessed raw data including conversion of '3+' dependents. Built an interactive UI and deployed the model for real-time use.
